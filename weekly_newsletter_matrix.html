<h1>Top Headlines</h1><h2>'Disgusting': Black Republicans livid over DeSantis' slavery attack</h2><h3>Category: Law & Crime</h3><p>A dispute has emerged among Black Republicans in Florida over new education standards regarding the teaching of Black history. Governor Ron DeSantis signed the revised guidelines that require middle school students to learn that "slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit." While Congressman Byron Donalds defended the guidelines as "robust and accurate," he objected to the notion of "personal benefit." In response, DeSantis' camp heavily criticized Donalds, prompting conservative Black Republicans to accuse them of running a smear campaign. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina also weighed in, criticizing DeSantis and asserting that there is no positive aspect to slavery.

In response, Russian forces pounded a key village in southern Ukraine, which Ukraine claims to have recaptured. Russia reported shooting down two Ukrainian missiles over its southern Rostov region, with debris injuring civilians in the city of Taganrog. Ukrainian officials rarely confirm such attacks, which have targeted Russian ammunition and fuel depots, military supply routes, and Russian-appointed officials in occupied Ukrainian territory. Meanwhile, Ukrainian and Russian forces are engaged in a battle for a strategic village in southeastern Ukraine. Capturing the village would provide Ukraine with a platform for further advances into Russian-held territory.</p><p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/28/moscow-accuses-ukraine-of-firing-missiles-at-southern-russia" target="_blank">Read more</a></p><hr>
