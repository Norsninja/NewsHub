# NewsAnalyzer System

## Introduction

Welcome to the NewsAnalyzer system, a powerful and sophisticated tool designed for in-depth research and analysis of news articles. This innovative platform is crafted to enable users, ranging from researchers, journalists, to enthusiasts, to dive deep into the world of news, exploring topics through an iterative, conversational approach.

### Statement of Purpose

The heart of the NewsAnalyzer system lies in its ability to create a dynamic, evolving conversation around news topics. Starting with an initial topic of interest, the system empowers users to progressively add news articles to the conversation, weaving a rich tapestry of information and insights. This iterative process allows for the exploration of a topic from multiple angles, offering a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

Crucially, the system is designed with flexibility in mind, enabling users to fine-tune the amount of documents and tokens used in the analysis. This feature ensures adherence to token limits of underlying AI models while maintaining the focus and depth of the research. Follow-up queries serve as a guiding tool, allowing users to steer the research direction towards specific goals or areas of interest.

## Integration with NewsHub System

### Overview

The NewsAnalyzer system is designed to work in tandem with the NewsHub system, a robust platform for scraping, categorizing, summarizing, and organizing news articles. Located in the root of the GitHub repository under the `NewsHub` folder, NewsHub serves as the foundational layer of data upon which NewsAnalyzer operates.

For installation details and more information on the NewsHub system, please visit [NewsHub Main Page](https://github.com/Norsninja/NewsHub/).

### How NewsHub Works

- **Scraping Headlines**: Utilizing Goose3 and Feedparser, NewsHub scrapes headlines from various news sources.
- **Categorizing Headlines**: Headlines are categorized into appropriate news categories using the GPT-3.5 Turbo 1106 model.
- **Summarizing Articles**: Each article is summarized concisely and neutrally with the GPT-3.5 Turbo 1106 model.
- **Caching Summaries**: Summaries are stored using Python's pickle module for efficient retrieval.
- **Grouping Summaries by Category**: Python algorithms organize these summaries into structured categories.
- **Generating Top Articles by Category**: The Sentence Transformer model (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) selects top articles in each category based on relevance.
- **Summarizing Daily Cache**: Daily news is summarized using the BART Large CNN model and PyTorch.
- **Generating Super Summary**: A Super Summary is created using GPT-4 1106 from the compiled top articles and summarized summaries.

### Role of NewsAnalyzer

NewsAnalyzer extends the capabilities of NewsHub by providing an interactive, in-depth research tool. Leveraging the processed and categorized data from NewsHub, it allows users to engage in a conversational, iterative exploration of news topics. The system is designed to:
- **Enhance Research**: Build upon the summaries and categories generated by NewsHub, allowing for deeper exploration of topics.
- **Iterative Analysis**: Progressively add news articles to a research conversation based on initial and follow-up queries.
- **Fine-tuned Control**: Adjust the amount of documents and tokens used in the analysis to maintain token limits and focus.
- **Direct Research**: Use follow-up queries to steer the research towards specific goals or areas of interest.
